Section 4.16. Day Count Fraction. "Day Count Fraction" means, in respect of a
Swap Transaction and the calculation of a Fixed Amount, a Floating Amount, a
Compounding Period Amount or an FRA Amount:

(a) if “1/1” is specified, 1;

(b) if “Actual/Actual”, “Actual/Actual (ISDA)”, “Act/Act” or “Act/Act (ISDA)”
is specified, the actual number of days in the Calculation Period or
Compounding Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 365 (or,
if any portion of that Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls in a leap
year, the sum of (i) the actual number of days in that portion of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falling in a leap year divided by 366
and (ii) the actual number of days in that portion of the Calculation Period or
Compounding Period falling in a non-leap year divided by 365);

(c) if “Actual/Actual (ICMA)” or “Act/Act (ICMA)” is specified, a fraction equal
to “number of days accrued/number of days in year”, as such terms are used in
Rule 251 of the statutes, by-laws, rules and recommendations of the
International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA Rule Book”), calculated in
accordance with Rule 251 of the ICMA Rule Book as applied to non US dollar
denominated straight and convertible bonds issued after December 31, 1998, as
though the interest coupon on a bond were being calculated for a coupon period
corresponding to the Calculation Period or Compounding Period in respect of
which payment is being made;

(d) if “Actual/365 (Fixed)”, “Act/365 (Fixed)”, “A/365 (Fixed)” or “A/365F” is
specified, the actual number of days in the Calculation Period or Compounding
Period in respect of which payment is being made divided by 365;

(e) if “Actual/360”, “Act/360” or “A/360” is specified, the actual number of
days in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period in respect of which payment
is being made divided by 360;

(f) if “30/360”, “360/360” or “Bond Basis” is specified, the number of days in
the Calculation Period or Compounding Period in respect of which payment is
being made divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows:

Numerator          = [360 * (Y2 - Y1)] + [30 * (M2 - M1)] + (D2 - D1)
Denominator        = 360
Day Count Fraction = Numerator / Denominator

where:
“Y1” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“Y2” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following
the last day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“M1” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“M2” is the calendar month, expressed as number, in which the day immediately
following the last day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period
falls;
“D1” is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Calculation Period
or Compounding Period, unless such number would be 31, in which case D1 will be
30; and
“D2” is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last
day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period, unless such number
would be 31 and D1 is greater than 29, in which case D 2 will be 30; and

(g) if “30E/360” or “Eurobond Basis” is specified, the number of days in the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period in respect of which payment is being
made divided by 360, calculated on a formula basis as follows:

Numerator          = [360 * (Y2 - Y1)] + [30 * (M2 - M1)] + (D2 - D1)
Denominator        = 360
Day Count Fraction = Numerator / Denominator

where:
“Y1” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“Y2” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following
the last
day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“M1” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“M2” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately
following the last day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period
falls;
“D1” is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Calculation Period
or Compounding Period, unless such number would be 31, in which case D1 will be
30; and “D2” is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following
the last day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period, unless
such number would be 31, in which case D2 will be 30.

(h) if “30E/360 (ISDA)” is specified, the number of days in the Calculation
Period or Compounding Period in respect of which payment is being made divided
by 360, calculated on a formula
basis as follows:

Numerator          = [360 * (Y2 - Y1)] + [30 * (M2 - M1)] + (D2 - D1)
Denominator        = 360
Day Count Fraction = Numerator / Denominator

where:
“Y1” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“Y2” is the year, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately following
the last day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“M1” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the first day of the
Calculation Period or Compounding Period falls;
“M2” is the calendar month, expressed as a number, in which the day immediately
following the last day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period
falls;
“D1” is the first calendar day, expressed as a number, of the Calculation Period
or Compounding Period, unless (i) that day is the last day of February or (ii)
such number would be 31, in which case D1 will be 30; and
“D2” is the calendar day, expressed as a number, immediately following the last
day included in the Calculation Period or Compounding Period, unless (i) that
day is the last day of February but not the Termination Date or (ii) such number
would be 31, in which case D2 will be 30.
